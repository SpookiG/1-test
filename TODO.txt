Ok, something something flying car what do I need?

Header files are @
~\Epic Games\UE_4.26\Engine\Source\Runtime\Engine\Classes

How the headers are organized is a fun adventure, I don't know what is going on here lol, components are everywhere. I found the file I need tho


- A level(s)
- Car
- Audio (optional? Though kinda important in some places)
- I want to take advantage of unreal's lighting effects (also kind of optional)
- An end to the game or way to exit (semi-optional depending on how sandboxy I go)
- A start to the game (definately optional & will probably have to learn a whole UI system to do)
- Multiple levels (definately optional again: I'm learning the engine so it's useful in the long run but I just want to be able to make a game at this point)


Essential tasks:
	- (3) level
		- learn level building
		- create sandboxy terrain area
		- create some roadways

	- (1) car
		- 1 Several control issues with the car
			- Bonus camera issue:
				- Camera spring arm keeps hitting the floor when the ship collides to fast into the ground, causing camera to jump into the floor


			- Getting stuck in geometry (This seems to happen w/ geometry positioned snugly (eg stacked boxes), so you can get around this a bit with level design)
				- Side note, sometimes u still get launched out vr far with this, I think I need to make a big open level(s)

		- Basically it's not great but I can work around it kind of with level design and I'll have at least an interesting game

	- (2) audio
		- crash noises on collisions
		- thruster noises on using car thrusters
		- hover noises? (maybe optional & potentially adds sound clutter if too loud)

	- (1) end game
		- press escape to end game
		- r to reset ship

Optionals (in priority order):
	- (4) end to the game
		- add some kind of target to reach (checkpoints and goals)

	- (5) unreal lighting effects
		- learn the lighting system
		- pick a nice atmospheric lighting
		- lights coming out of car for thrusters and hover thingies
		- I want a dynamic sun that moves around based on how fast player is moving and where, that would seem really cool (imagine going super fast and the sun drops right in front of u and casts super long shadows oh damn)

	

	- start to the game
		- add a start menu
		- add help screen to start menu with controls and a description of the objective

	- multiple levels
		- I don't think I'll get to this lol



Done!!!
	- write TODO list! lol
	- car body container
	- flattened cone main body
	- spring connector for camera
	- camera
	- physics connectors for thrusters
	- 3 thruster boxes
	- created a car shaped mesh thingy!!
	- car hovers above the ground!
	- car thrusts forward
	- car thrusts side to side
	- car swaps between the left and right thrusters depending on orientation
	- random jumps mostly resolved via adding a slippery material and removing some damping code from the thruster tick
	- Difficulty controling the car goind downhill resolved by locking y rotation on the top mesh and applying high angular damping when the car is close to the ground
	- Loss of control of car on steep slopes mitigated by adding turning velocity to the actual ship body when at high angles
	
	- NO MORE PHYSICS FIXES: This is the point where I'm going to stop focusing on physics issues because there isn't a clear end point to when these issues are going to stop and this is just an engine learning exercise done in my free time. The collision issue can be resolved via level design. The camera issue will be the last fix for the car as this isn't physics.
